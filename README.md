# Mimics

Mimics introduces a new mob to the game, called the Mimic. These sly creatures 
masquerade as chests in the world, and will attack any player that tries to 
open them. Be wary, they pack a mean bite and can fell a woefully unprepared 
adventuer in one hit if they're lucky.

But Mimics aren't all that terrible... if you do manage to subdue one of these 
strange monsters, you will receive any loot the mimic has picked up along with 
a Mimic Core! These cores can be used to craft your very own Mimic, which will 
follow you and assist in item collection and disposal. They will even help 
protect you when you are attacked by other mobs!
