~~Wild Mimic has following stats: 20 health, deals 10 hearts of damage on attack, 50% knockback resist~~
(10 hearts damage seems.... awful. Might need rebalancing)
~~Wild Mimic needs natural armor equiv. to leather ~~
(To be determined, current attack values offset necessity for armor, IMO)

~~Wild Mimic should lie in wait rendered as an actual ChestBlockEntity~~
~~ChestBlockEntity-rendered Wild Mimic should "transform back" when a player attempts to open it.~~
(These two items have been superceded by how wild mimics spawn)

~~Wild Mimic eats player items if killed player~~
~~Killing one drops a mimic core, 15 xp~~
~~Mimic heart + 8 planks crafted to make a Tamed Mimic Item.~~

~~Spawn in place of other chests that have a loot table assigned, with deathloottable expanded to include roll from originating chest~~
(This has been superceded by adding in 1/8 chance of spawn from attempting to open a loot table'd chest instead)

~~Tamed Mimic Item spawns Tamed Mimic on use~~
~~First-spawned Tamed Mimic imprints on user as its owner~~
~~Tamed Mimic should help with item collection~~
~~Tamed Mimic should help with item disposal~~
~~Tamed Mimic item disposal should "feed" Mimic to increase storage tiers: Stone > iron > gold > diamond > netherite~~
